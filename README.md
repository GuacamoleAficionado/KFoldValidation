# KFoldValidation

I am not particularly proud of the way the code in this project is organized.  That being said, I think overall it still shows some problem solving ability and that is why I'm making it public as something I can showcase to potential employers.  

If I was to go back and do it over again, surely I'd use OO design instead, and I'd also read the pgmPy docs thoroughly because I probably reinvented the wheel one or more times over the course of the project.

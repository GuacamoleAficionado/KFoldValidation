# KFoldValidation

I am not particularly proud of the way the code in this project is organized.  That being said, I think overall it still shows some problem solving ability and that is why I'm making it public as something I can showcase to potential employers.  

If I was to go back and do it over again, surely I'd use OO design instead, and I'd also read the pgmPy docs thoroughly because I probably reinvented the wheel one or more times over the course of the project. 

Also, the 'funny names' idea turned out to be pretty horrible in practice.  There should be some way to breifly encode actual info about the BN in a shortish file name so you're not having to guess which file contains info on which net.
